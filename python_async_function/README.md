python_async_function - Asynchronous Python Examples
This folder contains Python scripts focused on learning asynchronous programming using async and await.

Asynchronous programming allows running multiple tasks concurrently instead of waiting for each to finish before starting the next, which is useful for I/O-bound operations.

üìö Topics Covered
Basic async function syntax

Running concurrent coroutines

Measuring runtime differences

Creating and managing asyncio tasks
